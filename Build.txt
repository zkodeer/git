It can be difficult to know exactly how to make someone happy, as each person is unique and has their own specific needs and preferences. However, here are a few general tips that might help you try to make an angry girl happy:

First, try to understand the cause of her anger. Is there something specific that is bothering her? If you can identify the root cause of her anger, it might be easier to address the issue and find a solution.

Show her that you care about her and are there for her. This can be as simple as listening to her when she talks and offering words of support and encouragement.

Try to do something kind for her. This could be something small, like making her favorite meal or bringing her a small gift.

Give her space if she needs it. Sometimes, people just need some time alone to process their emotions. Respect her need for space and give her the time she needs.

It's important to remember that everyone has different ways of coping with and expressing their emotions, and what works for one person might not work for another. The most important thing is to be supportive and understanding, and to try to find a solution that works for both of you.
